            <h3 id="aviation2">Flying, like life, is full of precluded possibilities</h3>
            <p><span class="setail">Over the last hundred years, such leaps forward have been made in new aviation technology, fueled by the ever-increasing demand for mobility around the planet for leisure and for business. Various wars throughout the twentieth century helped to push forward with progress as governments made funds available to find ways to fly faster and higher than the enemy. <br>
                Airlines are now demanding more from plane makers. They need to reduce their kilometre/seat costs, they need to observe more stringent noise reduction laws enforced by airport authorities as their airfields are being surrounded by creeping urban expansion.  Aircraft construction materials need to be lighter and more impervious to corrosion. </span>

            <h4>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PASSENGER’S SATISFACTION 
                FROM THE SERVICE QUALITY OF THE KING ABDULAZIZ 
                INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA</h4>
            <p class="second-text">
                The main aim of this study was to investigate the satisfaction of passengers from service quality of King Abdulaziz International Airport Jeddah. This is quantitative study based on primary data.A structured close-ended questionnaire developed in English and translated into Arabic for highresponse, distributed among the passengers who ever travelled from KAIAJ. The researcher used Convenience sampling technique to identify the respondents who came from across the country for counseling classes at college of business and writing their final exams. The study sample size was 400 respondents. The satisfaction level of the passengers from the services of the KAIAJ, at large was low. Just for three variables from eleven given variables, the passengers showed somewhat satisfaction with mean value just above three. For all other service variables, the passengers were not satisfied. The management of KAIAJ should focus on enhancing the experience of the passengers. There were eleven service areas in this research, which can be individually be taken up for improvement of the services.

            <h1>The damage of the passenger guarantee will be discussed in the Parliament</h1>
            <strong><small><i>Author: Ibnun Nafis</i></small></strong>
            <p class="second-para">
                <strong>It was emphasized that the state airports management (DHMI), which will be examined by the CPC Commission, had a public loss of $65 million due to the passenger guarantees given due to build-operate transfer <br>
                    Discussions on objections to the CIS reports for 2011-2016 on behalf of the CHP group will be held at the CIS Commission on November 6-7. Accordingly, objections to the reports of DHMI as well as ÇAYKUR, Ataturk Forest Farm Directorate, TRT, Tokİ and General Directorate of State Railways Management will be discussed. <br>
                    ChP's objection to the third airport in Istanbul (Istanbul Airport) stated that guaranteeing passengers meant that all risks of the project would be covered by the public. Over the CHP's objection, the DHMI's response to the commission stated that the public loss of passenger guarantees due to build-operate-transfer projects was $65 million. "Our organization has paid $443 million to our administration to date due to passenger guarantees in the build-operate-transfer projects carried out to date, and $65 million has been paid to the private sector due to guaranteed realizations," the DHMI response said.</strong>

            <h1>Airbus 380| The giant in the sky</h1>
            <p class="lastp1"><strong>The A380 was a masterpiece of engineering, beloved of passengers everywhere. But, for carriers, it just didn’t work.With a passenger capacity of around 550 in a three or four class layout, the A380 was ideally suited to carry the most amount of passengers over a long distance. At the time when it was designed, it ticked all the boxes for carriers working on a hub and spoke model for their networks.At airports where slots are super congested, carriers could snag the lion’s share of passengers on every slot they held. As such, the aircraft remains a popular model with hub based airline Emirates. However, even they are looking to other aircraft for their future needs.the world as a whole is becoming more prosperous and air travel is becoming more affordable to the rising middle classes. India, China and other nations in the Far East are set to see explosive growth over the next decade. As such, perhaps there is a market for an aircraft that can seat a ton of passengers and take them anywhere in the world? In India, for example, key hubs at Mumbai and Delhi are both already completely slot deprived.</strong>

            <h1>Boeing 747| The queen of the sky</h1>
            <p class="lastp2">
                <strong>Boeing 747 8 Specs, shown below will illustrate how the Boeing 747 8 Freighter and 747 8 Intercontinental are the largest iterations of the classic Boeing 747 model which has ruled the skies for four decades. It is the largest and heaviest aircraft produced in the United States.s we have seen, however, like the Airbus A380, the 747 8 has come to market at a time when interest in large 4 engine jets is waning. The day of the giant twin-engined jets is at hand, fairly well sealing the doom of the jumbos. Fortunately for Boeing, the original design of the Boeing 747 with the cockpit located in the top bubble allowed for a nose door to be installed. Initially, it was not assumed that the passenger version of the 747 would catch on, so Boeing took an each-way bet and ensured the design would fit freight airliners needs, should the passenger version fail. By having the cockpit raised above the main deck, cargo can therefore be passed longitudinally through the nose door along the main deck. This allows for longer items to be easily loaded. Airbus, with their A380, do not have that same luxury.</strong>
