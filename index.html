            <h1 id="aviation1">Welcome to Today's Aviation!</h1>
            <h3 id="aviation2">Flying, like life, is full of precluded possibilities</h3>
            <p><span class="setail">Over the last hundred years, such leaps forward have been made in new aviation technology, fueled by the ever-increasing demand for mobility around the planet for leisure and for business. Various wars throughout the twentieth century helped to push forward with progress as governments made funds available to find ways to fly faster and higher than the enemy. <br>
                Airlines are now demanding more from plane makers. They need to reduce their kilometre/seat costs, they need to observe more stringent noise reduction laws enforced by airport authorities as their airfields are being surrounded by creeping urban expansion.  Aircraft construction materials need to be lighter and more impervious to corrosion. </span>

            <h1>The damage of the passenger guarantee will be discussed in the Parliament</h1>

            <p class="second-para">
                <strong>It was emphasized that the state airports management (DHMI), which will be examined by the CPC Commission, had a public loss of $65 million due to the passenger guarantees given due to build-operate transfer <br>
                    Discussions on objections to the CIS reports for 2011-2016 on behalf of the CHP group will be held at the CIS Commission on November 6-7. Accordingly, objections to the reports of DHMI as well as ÇAYKUR, Ataturk Forest Farm Directorate, TRT, Tokİ and General Directorate of State Railways Management will be discussed. <br>
                    ChP's objection to the third airport in Istanbul (Istanbul Airport) stated that guaranteeing passengers meant that all risks of the project would be covered by the public. Over the CHP's objection, the DHMI's response to the commission stated that the public loss of passenger guarantees due to build-operate-transfer projects was $65 million. "Our organization has paid $443 million to our administration to date due to passenger guarantees in the build-operate-transfer projects carried out to date, and $65 million has been paid to the private sector due to guaranteed realizations," the DHMI response said.</strong>
